How to build XtraBackup
=======================

!!You need to build the MySQL binaries before building XtraBackup!!

1. Build your version of mysql

2. copy the xtrabackup  source directory into the mysql.5x/innobase directory
   (e.g. mysql-5.0.75/innobase/xtrabackup-0.0 )

3. For 5.1x you need to apply a patch.
   From the innobase directory, apply the xtrabackup patch. 
  e.g. #patch -p2 < xtrabackup-0.0/fix_innodb_for_backup51.patch  
  
(With 5.0 run 'make clean all' from the innobase directory This is necessary
for 5.0, because of the lack of dependencies)

4.Run make [5.0] [5.1] [xtradb] [plugin] in the XtraBackup directory.

5.  enjoy... :
