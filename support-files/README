A few notes on the deb and rpm directories...



Rationale:

We strive to provide a way to build DEB and RPM packages directly from drizzle 
sources. This should work both from a bzr tree as well as a source tar ball with
a simple "make deb" and "make rpm" respectively. (see support-files/include.am)
The changelog and spec files are automatically generated in the ./configure
phase, so that version will automatically match the source version you are
building from.

By keeping the packaging scripts within the drizzle repository itself, we also
want to provide a common base for distro packagers to work from. We realize you
probably won't do "make rpm|deb" yourself, but at least consider the spec/debian
scripts as a base to work from, and please push any enhancements back upstream.

Finally, going forward we hope to minimize the amount of "enhancements" done
in the packaging phase, so that any patches, conf files, init files, etc...
are moved to the actual drizzle sources. (But this will not yet be reality for
7.1 release.)



Status:

We missed the boat on having this included in the sources for the 7.1 -rc.
The plan now is to maintain a parallel repository 
lp:~drizzle-developers/drizzle/drizzle-7.1-packaging which will merge from trunk.

Once we start working on 7.2, we hope to merge this into trunk asap.

First packages are now released based on 7.1.31-rc. For Fedora 16
we don't have any systemd support yet so Fedora packages were not released.

See https://blueprints.launchpad.net/drizzle/+spec/7.1-packaging for more 
details and most current status.
